# Data-extraction-conversion-and-build-a-CSV-file-output

As discussed in Homework 1 many ETL (extraction, transformation, and loading)
problems parse data files wherein the data fields is separated by commas. This
assignment is a continuation of that process - with an additional two steps. The first
step is to convert the input file’s latitude and longitude from sexagesimal (base 60)
degrees to decimal degrees. For example, the inputs are in the form: degrees,
minutes and seconds, arcseconds and direction. The outputs are in the form: sign,
degrees, and decimal fractions to represent the same value.
This assignment requires the data extraction, degree conversion, data formatting,
and output. The file inputs are defined in the Inputs, as are the outputs.
The verification of the output data will be the plotting of the output file’s airport
information in a Javascript enable web page.
